## 📂 Projects

Due to confidentiality agreements and agency work, I am unable to share specific project details here. However, I am more than happy to discuss my contributions and the types of projects I’ve worked on — just reach out, and let's chat!

## 🔒 Why No Portfolio?

Most of my work is under **NDAs** or private client contracts with an agency.  
However, I’m happy to talk about what I’ve done — just send a message and let’s chat!
